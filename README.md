# simple2quicken

A simple command line tool for converting [Simple](http://simple.com) CSV exported transactions into the QIF format suitable for import into Quicken.

## Usage

Note: this assumes you have a modernish ruby environment installed.  Right now I'm on `ruby 1.9.3p429 (2013-05-15 revision 40747) [x86_64-darwin12.3.0]` installed with rvm in `/Users/jdw5/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p429/bin/ruby`.  There's a good chance the following will work on your vanilla Mac OS > 10.6 or modernish Linux installation.  YMMV; send me an email if it doesn't and I'll try to help you.

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec simple2quicken.rb <transaction filename> <qif output filename> <quicken account name>
```

`quicken account name` can be a new or existing one.  See [this community forum post](https://qlc.intuit.com/questions/153976-how-to-import-qif-files-into-non-cash-accounts-post-q2004) for details on how to do the import.  `simple2quicken` prepends the proper header (per that article), so start with the "Then in Quicken" section.  I had to have a `cash` account created already.

## TODO

* making sure this works properly with new transactions (we currently don't de-dup, you'll have to do that manually)
* "Cleared" and "Categories"
